## Read Me Generator Tutorial Walkthrough

[Program Walkthrough](https://youtu.be/NriajmS5bBc)

## Overview

This small project was to get use to installing and managing npm packages. In this project the main tools I used was the npm Inquirer package and the built in file system class. These tools allowed me to take in user inputs and write them to a text file. This was one of the shorter projects that I finished. NPM is a streamlined program that is very easy to use so most parts of the project were fairly easy. Ultimately this program taught me more about the important aspects of a Read Me file and the purposes of a license and why every project should use one. This is also the first time I have experienced writing code in different classes in order to keep things organized and readable in the future. 

## Further Development

This program is currently in its most basic form. If I ever revist this project I would add on more functionality to customizing the Read Me based on the user preference. Being able to customize section or change the order the sections appear in would be at the top of the list. The limitation of the project is that I wanted to learn more about the command line, and being able to change the order of the sections or make adding certain markdown feature to the Read Me would be best suited for a program with a proper GUI. I think the next iteration of the program could exist on an independent website where the user has more freedom than just a command line to interact with the program.
